# Poemlapse

Poemlapse is a clone of the software behind [Midst](http://midst.press/), a poetry journal that allows its readers to experience a poem chronologically, from the first keystroke to the final draft.

Using Poemlapse, you can write poems and replay your process in the editor. Work on drafts, and publish them for others to view. Browse recent works and save your favorites.

The Poemlapse app is just a demo, but if you'd like to see real poetry in process, check out [Midst](http://midst.press/). Midst is a digital journal publishing poems in the form of interactive timelapses. You can explore Midst's [issues](http://midst.press/read) and learn more at their [website](http://midst.press/about). You can also support Midst by becoming a [patron](https://www.patreon.com/midstpoetry).

This demo was created with permission from the Midst team, although it is not an official part of the project. I am grateful to their generosity in letting me play with their beautiful concept.
